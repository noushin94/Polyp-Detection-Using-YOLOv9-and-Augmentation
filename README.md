## üåü Introduction

Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is particularly deadly, with polyps being early indicators of potential malignancies. Early detection through endoscopy and advanced deep learning models can significantly improve treatment outcomes.

## üß† YOLOv9 Architecture

In the latest version of YOLOv9, modern deep neural networks incorporate deeper layers to enhance object detection accuracy. However, during the feedforward process, many informative features of the input may be lost. YOLOv9 addresses this issue with a new architecture named GELAN, designed to capture the most informative features and process them efficiently.

Reversible architectures, masked modeling, and deep supervision are three distinct methods used to enhance neural networks' capability to retain and manipulate meaningful information throughout training and inference processes. YOLOv9 introduces 'Programmable Gradient Information' (PGI), which adapts the main propagation technique originally used in deep supervision by programming it to enhance meaningful feature extraction.

## üî¨ Experiments

### Base YOLOv9

The pre-trained YOLOv9 model was fine-tuned on the Kvasir dataset. Initial training results showed promising improvements in polyp detection accuracy.

![Training Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repository/path/to/image_page12_0.png)

| Class  | Precision | Recall | mAP 50 | mAP 50:90 |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| All    | 0.829     | 0.85   | 0.87   | 0.563     |
| Labels | 0.833     | 0.942  | 0.897  | 0.683     |
| Polyps | 0.825     | 0.757  | 0.843  | 0.443     |

### YOLOv9 with HSV

By converting images from RGB to HSV color space, we observed better performance in detecting polyps due to improved handling of light reflections on polyp surfaces.

| Class  | Precision | Recall | mAP 50 | mAP 50:90 |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| All    | 0.85      | 0.861  | 0.87   | 0.57      |
| Labels | 0.844     | 0.948  | 0.894  | 0.679     |
| Polyps | 0.856     | 0.773  | 0.857  | 0.471     |

### YOLOv9 with HSV, Shearing, Translation, and Rotation

Adding geometric transformations such as shearing, translation, and rotation did not significantly improve the model's performance. However, these experiments provided valuable insights into the effects of different augmentations.

## üìà Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of using advanced deep learning techniques, specifically the YOLOv9 model, for polyp detection in colonoscopy images. Data augmentation techniques, particularly HSV adjustments, significantly enhance model accuracy and robustness.
